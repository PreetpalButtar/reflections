I would like to create a new file on GitHub rather than on my local computer whne I'm working on a project in collaboration with some other developers and the developers are located at remote locations.

I have to manually pull the changes form GitHub rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with my remote repository because only I can decide when some logical changes have occurrred on GitHub.

Fork is used when copying some other user's repo on GitHub to your own repo on GitHub.
Clone is for copying a repo from a remote computer to a local computer or to create a copy of a repo on a local computer itself.
Branch is used when you are adding a new feature or doing some experiment.

The benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally helps us to know at which stage the remote copy is.
It would be very hard to collaborate without using Git or GitHub.
